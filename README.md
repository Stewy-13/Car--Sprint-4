## Project Descritption
In this project I developed and deployed an web application through the render platform. In the app you will find a histogram for 'Odometer vs Price', a scatter plpt for'Year vs Price', and a check box for anyone who prefers automatic transmissions over manual. When the check box ix clicked another histogram will depoly distribution of transmission types across different manufacturers. 

Juypter Notebook
For the juypter notebook requirement of the project I used the same dataset and chose to focus on transmission types. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into consumer preferences for automatic and manual transmissions across different manufacturers.
